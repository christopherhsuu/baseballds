Using HALPE_26 model (body and feet) for pose estimation.

No valid CUDA installation found: using OpenVINO backend with CPU.

Pose tracking set up for "body_with_feet" model.
Mode: balanced.

Persons are detected every 4 frames and tracked inbetween. Multi-person is selected.
Parameters: keypoint_likelihood_threshold=0.3, average_likelihood_threshold=0.5, keypoint_number_threshold=0.3
Skipping right wrist angle computation because at least one of the following keypoints is not provided by the model: ['RElbow', 'RWrist', 'RIndex'].
Skipping left wrist angle computation because at least one of the following keypoints is not provided by the model: ['LElbow', 'LIndex', 'LWrist'].
